                    <p> Hey everyone, 1.5.6 is out now.</p>
                    <p>Dolls have been a part of human culture for hundreds of years. While early dolls were made of materials such as wood, clay or wax,
                        porcelain became a popular material to use in doll construction in the 19th century. The Chinese and the French began making china heads for dolls in the 1840s.
                        In 1880, the French popularized the "bebe,‚Äù which was one of the first dolls made to represent a child. Though beautiful, porcelain dolls are fragile and need to be repaired from time to time.</p>

                <p> However I recently became sick (not Covid) so it would have been hard to return full-blast.
                    To buy myself a little more time, I'm uploading this video that I made over a year ago but never published. Just a couple of tips that I've picked up over the years.
                    These are pretty minor tips, and some of these might be obvious to long-time hobbyists. But maybe not everybody knows them, so I thought, why not share?</p>

                    <p>Introduction:
                        As a doctor who specializes in fixing board games, I've seen my fair share of broken games. One game that I was recently asked to fix was "Goose Board".
                        For those who may not know, "Goose Board" is a classic board game that has been around for centuries. However, over time, the game has lost some of its charm and
                        has become outdated. That's where I came in. In this blog post, I'm going to talk about how I fixed "Goose Board" and brought it back to life.<br>
                        <br>
                        Background:
                        Before I dive into how I fixed "Goose Board", let me give you some background on the game. "Goose Board" is a race game where players move their pieces
                        along a track by rolling dice. Along the way, there are spaces with special instructions, such as "Goose" which allows the player to move again or "Inn"
                        which requires the player to miss a turn. The first player to reach the final space wins.<br>
                        <br>
                        Challenges:
                        The biggest challenge with "Goose Board" was that it lacked excitement. Players simply rolled dice and moved along the track without any real strategy.
                        In addition, the game had a lot of "dead" spaces where nothing happened, which made the game drag on. My goal was to add some excitement to the game and make
                        it more engaging for players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Solution:
                        To solve the issues with "Goose Board", I added some new elements to the game. First, I added some new spaces with unique instructions.
                        For example, I added a space called "Shortcut" which allowed players to skip ahead a few spaces. I also added a space called "Trap" which required players
                        to go back a few spaces. These new spaces added some unpredictability to the game and gave players some tough decisions to make.<br>
                        <br>
                        Another change I made was to the movement of the pieces. Instead of simply moving along the track, players could now move their pieces in any direction
                        they wanted. This added a strategic element to the game and made it more challenging.<br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, I added some new game pieces to "Goose Board". Instead of the traditional game pieces, I added some unique pieces such as a car,
                        a spaceship, and a dragon. These new pieces added some visual interest to the game and made it more appealing to players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Conclusion:
                        In the end, my changes to "Goose Board" were a success. Players now had to think strategically about their moves and the game had some
                        unpredictable moments that kept players engaged. The new game pieces also added some visual interest to the game and made it more appealing.
                        If you're a fan of "Goose Board", I encourage you to try out the new and improved version of the game. It's sure to bring some excitement back to this classic game.</p>
